TENDERMAPS REDUX

description: a sketchpad app for tendermaps.com

this was hacked together in the span of a couple hours. it's still in prototype-phase.

the backend does nothing so far. rasterizing functions will be added later, and will plug in to zain's thinger (https://github.com/zain/tendermaps/blob/master/tendermaps.py).

not currently deployed anywhere (i don't have access to a public webserver), but there are examples of what it looks like in the "examples" folder.
